# Data Science in Production

# Introduction

This is a project that shows my progress in Data Science training in production. 

Data Science in Prodution is a course taught by data scientist **Meigarom Lopes**. It teaches how to build a data science project using an easy-to-understand methodology. And in the end, he teaches how to deploy the model in production.

The challange of this project is to make a sales prevision of **Rossmann's Store**. So, we used the datasets from *Kaggle**

This project is divided into 10 modules where the necessary steps to make a complete data science project are presented. They are:

- Understanding the Bussiness Problem

- Data Description

- Featuring Engineering

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Data Preparation

- Feature Selection

- Machine Learning Modeling

- Hyperparameter Fine Tuning

- Error Translation and Interpretation 

- Deploy Model to Production

# Module 01 - Understanding the business problem
